I blog in free time, video edits in weekends, own meme pages and youtube channel, 

In a world where demand for technology is increasing steadily every day, I aim to be part of its innovation and leave my symbol in this era.

Okay, but why did I chose CS? If you have watched the Steve Jobs movie, in the endng scene, Michael Fassbender sees her daughter carrying music cassettes in her bag and says to her - "Gotta put music in your pocket. 100 songs. 1000 songs. Somewhere between 500 & 1000 songs right in your pocket, because I can't stand looking at that inexplicable Walkman anymore. You're carrying around a brick playing cassette tape. We're not savages. So I'm gonna put a thousand songs in your pocket"
